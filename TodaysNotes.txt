IO Package

What is the IO Package?

Io is package which provides set of predfined classes and interfaces to perform input and output operations on the console has wel has FileSystem.


How does the I/O happen in java?

Java uses I/O Streams to perform I/O operation both on console and Filesystem



What is a Stream?

Stream is a connection between a java program and a file/console.
Stream can be also be termed as flow of data between java programme and some media





Source                                          Destination

Program     <----------------Stream(byte)----------------->File/Console



Input------> Read Data------->InputStream
Output------> Writing data---->OutputStream

All the Stream classes are under java.io.


IO

ByteBased Streams

AC-InputStream

C-DataInputStream
C-FileInputStream
C-ByteArrayInputStream






AC-OutputStream
C-DataOutputStream
C-FileOutputStream
C-ByteArrayOutputStream


I want read data from console
C-DataInputStream


I want read data from filesystem
C-FileInputStream


I want read data from the in-memory managed by the VM
C-ByteArraInputStream




Streams----------->Byte-------------8 bits


In java-----we have 2 types of Stream?



Character Based Streams----> character



Reader
BufferedReader
InputStreamReader---------------------->FileReader
StringReader


*******************************
Writer
BufferedWriter
InputStreamWriter---------------------->FileWriter
StringWriter



Use of BytebasedStreams
1.Can read or write textfiles,images,audio files........

Use of CharacterbasedStreams
1.TextFile




1. Using Byte Streams to read data from the console(DataInputStream)
2. Using Character Stream to read the data from the console.(BufferedReader)











System.out.println();


println()----method

out-----() reference of outputStream

System is a class under java.lang package



Reading the Data from the File





Requiremet Assignment Work

MultiThreading
1. Create an Application with using multithreading where one thread perform reading of data and another thread will write the read data
